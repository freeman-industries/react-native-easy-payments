Welcome to the best and most comprehensive library for integrating payments into your React Native app.

This library is designed to be fully compatible with React Native 0.60 and onwards.

# Installation

```
npm install --save react-native-payments
```

## iOS

```
cd ios
pod install
```

## Android

```
npx jetify
```

# Guides

Please note: the current `examples` directory hasn't been updated since the fork. They probably won't work out of the box, but feel free to explore the code.

- Stripe: Apple Pay

# Roadmap

## In progress

- Stripe: Payment Intents (for SCA)

## Planned

- Web: Apple Pay
- Stripe: Android Pay
- Braintree: Apple Pay
- Braintree: Android Pay

This is a fork of https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-payments, where Naoufal already did a lot of the hard work integrating Android and Braintree.

The library fell out of regular maintenance and is not compatible with later React Native versions, but our plan is to revive that code as we believe 80% of it (or more) is still useful.

All contributions, big or small are welcomed.

For large PRs, please open an issue and have a discussion with us first before you dive in.

Our plan for this library is for it to be useful to all React Native developers so we want to architect it carefully.
