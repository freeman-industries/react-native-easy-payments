# react-native-easy-payments

Welcome to the best and most comprehensive library for integrating payments into your React Native app.

This library is designed to be fully compatible with React Native 0.60 and onwards.

# Installation

```
npm install --save react-native-easy-payments
```

## iOS

```
cd ios
pod install
```

## Android

```
npx jetify
```

# Guides

- Stripe: Apple Pay

# Roadmap

## In progress

- Stripe: Payment Intents (for SCA)

## Planned

- Web: Apple Pay
- Stripe: Android Pay
- Braintree: Apple Pay
- Braintree: Android Pay

This is a fork of https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-payments, where Naoufal already did a lot of the hard work integrating Android and Braintree.

The library fell out of regular maintenance and is not compatible with later React Native versions, but our plan is to revive that code as we believe 80% of it (or more) is still useful.
